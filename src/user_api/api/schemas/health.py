    Reported at both levels deliberately: the top-level status is what a load balancer
    reads, the per-check detail is what a human reads at three in the morning.

    Nothing here is sensitive. This is the one endpoint that does not require
    authentication, so every field on it is written on the assumption that a stranger can
    read it -- counts and yes/no answers, never a key, a value, or a path. In particular it
    reports no per-account anything: a count that moved when one person wrote something
    would be an oracle on an unauthenticated endpoint, which is exactly the mistake keyring
    made once and documented.
