"""Request-scoped cross-cutting behaviour.

One middleware, doing what belongs to a single span: give the request an id, make that
id visible to every log record it produces, and record how long it took. The
authenticated account is bound separately, by the dependency that resolves it, because
it is not known until the route's dependencies run.
