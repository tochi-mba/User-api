"""Per-request context.

Two facts are attached once, at the edge, and read wherever they are needed without being
threaded through every signature: the request id, and the account the request was
authenticated as. Context variables are task-local, so two people's concurrent requests
can never see each other's identity -- which is the mechanism the whole isolation story
rests on, and is tested as such.

The account id is the *only* identifier this service ever learns about a person. It comes
out of a verified token's ``sub`` claim and appears in no URL, which is why binding it
here is safe to log: it names a row, not a human being.
