"""How a moment in time becomes a column, and comes back unchanged.

SQLite has no date type, so this is a decision rather than a detail, and there are two
properties to preserve:

**Timezone awareness survives the round trip.** Nothing in this service reads a naive
datetime -- every staleness comparison and every grace-period calculation is against a
UTC-aware one -- so a column that returned a naive datetime would raise at the first
comparison, in a code path far from the store that produced it.

**Lexicographic order matches chronological order.** Cursor pagination, the ``updated_at``
ordering, ``?stale_before=`` and the purge sweep all sort and compare on these columns, in
SQL, as text. That only works because the format is fixed width: a stamp whose
microseconds were omitted when zero would sort *after* one that kept them, and a cursor
would then skip a row or return one twice.

Both are pinned by tests, because both fail silently.
