"""Numbered SQL files, applied in order, recorded as they go.

Hand-rolled rather than Alembic. What a migration tool buys is autogeneration from an
ORM and support for a dozen engines; there is no ORM here and there is one engine, so
what would be left is "run these files in order", which is this module.

Each file is applied inside its own transaction, with the version recorded in the same
transaction. SQLite has transactional DDL, so a migration that fails halfway leaves the
schema exactly as it was rather than half-changed with nothing to say so.

One driver wrinkle worth knowing before editing this: ``executescript`` **commits any
open transaction before it runs**, so a migration cannot be wrapped in a ``BEGIN`` issued
from outside it. The ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` is therefore prepended to the script text, where
``executescript`` runs it as part of the script and leaves the transaction open for the
version row that follows.
